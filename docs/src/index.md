# aDDM-Toolbox

This Github organization provides toolboxes to fit the attentional drift diffusion model described in [Krajbich, Armel and Rangel (2010)](https://www.nature.com/articles/nn.2635) using the algorithm described in [Tavares, Perona, Rangel (2017)](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2017.00468/full) in various programming languages.

The project is developed and maintained by the [Rangel Neuroeconomics Lab](https://www.rnl.caltech.edu/index.html) at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu/).
